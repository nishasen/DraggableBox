          <h3>This is a short story on my journey of becoming a Frontend Developer</h3>
          <p>Hey, This is Nisha Sen, and I am a Frontend developer by proffession. I love to build stuff not with bricks and cement but by coding it out. While I was very new to this field, I always got facinated by viewing various sites. I used to think how can this be coded out. A funny thing that happened while I was in college in suddenly there was out-break of corona virus. After that we got cowin website to register for vaccination. I did not like the the website at all, neither I knew much tools on web development at that time, but I felt like this site could be remade, so I randomly choose an online site building website and started building the cowin site. After building some of the designs I found out it was just a template, which is not functional. I left that there itself and gradually I got a urge to learn frontend development and build websites. After searching a lot, and found out some resources but it was not helping me that much. Then I found a bootcamp where I got a chance to learn JavaScript, ReactJS, html, css and grew a lot of interest in these field. Now I feel like web development has become a hobby. I enjoy coding new websites with new challenges everyday. I am still learning and enjoying every bit of it.</p>
